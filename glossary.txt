-- Definition 1 (Inhabited types) --
A type, _A_, is inhabited in an environment _E_ 
and a context _Sigma_ if there exists a term _t_ such
that the _E,Sigma |- t:A_ holds.

-- Conversions/Reductions ---
* alpha conversion  : renaming bound variables
* delta reduction   : unaliasing, aka unfolding
* beta reduction    : argument application
* zeta reduction    : local bindings, let
* iota reduction    : inductive types???

-- Definition 2 (Specification) --
Every term whose type is Set is called a specification.

-- Definition 3 (Programs) --
Every term whose type is a specification is called a program.

-- Minimal Propositional Logic --
Logic system in which formulae are constructed exclusively
from propositional variables and implication. All
Props in MPL can be solved using only:
  intros and apply/assumption 

-- Definition 4 (Proposition, proof term) --
Every type _P_ whose type is the sort Prop is called
a proposition. Any term t whose type is a proposition
is called a proof term, or, for short, a proof.

-- Definition 5 (Hypothesis) --
A local declaration _h:P_ where _h_ is an identifier
and _P_ is a proposition is called a hypothesis. The
identifier _h_ is the name of the hypothesis and _P_
is its statement.

-- Definition 6 (Axiom) --
A global declaration _x:P_ where _x_ is an identifier
and _P_ is a proposition is called an axiom.

-- Definition 7 (Theorems, Lemmas) --
Global definitions of identifiers whose type is
a proposition, are called theorems or lemmas.

-- Definition 8 (Goal) --
A goal is the pairing of two pieces of information: a
local context _Gamma_ and a type _t_ that is well-formed
in this context.

-- Definition 9 (Tactics) --
Tactics are commands that can be applied to a goal.
Their effect is to produce a new, possibly empty,
list of goals. If _g_ is the input goal and 
g_l, ... , g_k are the output goals, the tactic has an
associated function that makes it possible to construct
a solution of g from the solutions of goals g_iÂ·
